QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AFTER HOMEWORK
====================================

* No real issues. After all the classwork and homework, I know enough JS and jQuery functions now to know what to use to do what.
* Thanks for the note about how to fix the issue of the images getting oddly positioned if the 'next'/'previous' button is clicked while the slider animation is still going (https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LDN_3_Work/pull/348#issuecomment-27957022). I have implemented this fix in my w6d4 classwork version, together with an updated 'updateNavVisibility' function to solve the missing 'next'/'previous' button issue we came across in class.
