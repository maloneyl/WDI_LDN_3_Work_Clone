Tonight's Homework:

Buidling on the Calc-It app you've done in class today, add the three following features:

Mortgage Calculator:
Calculate the monthly payment when given the other variables as input.
you need principal, yearly interest rate and the number of payments

BMI Calculator:
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight - the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system

Trip Calculator:
This feature asks the user for four inputs:
- Distance – how far will you drive?
- MPG – what is the fuel efficiency of the car?
- $PG – how much does gas cost per gallon?
- Speed – how fast will you drive?
The output is a string: “Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost $255.33.”
For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG. (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative.)
