Someone has googled you recently.
Something good will happen today (depending on how you define "good").
This is not the fortune you're looking for.
You can always find happiness on Friday.
Your code might suck now, but it will get better . . . I think.
Drink more coffee.
You'll have a free lunch on Thursday.
It's about time I got out of that text file!
You are going to die one day.
Today may or may not be awesome.
You will be hungry soon.
