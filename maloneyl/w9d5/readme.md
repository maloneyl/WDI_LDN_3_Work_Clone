PROJECT IDEA
------------

For my final project, I'm thinking of re-creating Co-op (www.coopapp.com; an app that lets a team share status updates while tracking time if linked to a Harvest account/timesheet). I'd like my version of Co-op to come with a basic time-tracker, and perhaps even a little bit more styling than the current version.

I expect my app to involve Devise, Cancan and a good deal of JavaScript. Not sure how I'm going to manage the time-tracking and invite-only groups yet, but I'll look into it more. I hope by day 1 I'll have a clearer idea as to the tools I'll need and also have the MVP defined.
